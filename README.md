# Quizzer

Quizzer is a web application which allows users to take quizzes and create their own for other users to try. This application was developed for the final project of Harvard University's '[CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)' online course, written with HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap) and JavaScript on the front-end and Python with the Django web framework on the back-end.
